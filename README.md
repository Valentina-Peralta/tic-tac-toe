# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe repository! This classic game is designed to resemble a hand-drawn experience.
It is built using React. The hand-drawn appearance is achieved through custom styling and CSS.

## Working on
The Tic-Tac-Toe application is still a work in progress. Currently, you can enjoy playing the game against another player. However, I have exciting plans to introduce new features and enhancements in the near future, including:

- **Play against the computer**: I am working on integrating an AI player for single-player mode.
- **Customization options**: I will be adding features to allow players to personalize the game, such as choosing different themes, board sizes, or symbols.
- **Game history:** I plan to implement a game history feature that will allow players to review and revisit their past matches.

## I look forward to sharing the upcoming features and enhancements with you. Enjoy playing the game and stay tuned for updates!
